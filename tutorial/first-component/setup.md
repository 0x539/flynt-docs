# Tutorial: Getting Started

To get started, clone the flynt-theme and checkout the tutorial branch.

```
git clone -b tutorial-setup https://github.com/flyntwp/theme.git
```

Then use the [Flynt CLI](../../cli/README.md) to setup the project:

```
flynt setup
```

<!-- TODO: Add link / text about actually doing all of the required local setup steps. e.g. Set up MAMP -->
