# Page Templates

All template files can be found under the theme root, in the `templates` directory.

By default, the following standard WordPress templates are included. These templates follow the normal [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/), and work in exactly the same way:
- `404.php`
- `archive.php`
- `home.php`
- `index.php`
- `page.php`
- `single.php`

By default, the following custom page template is also included:
- `plugin-inactive.php` - This is displayed when the Flynt plugin is disabled.
